# Project-Predicting-Bike-Rentals
Using Python, building random forest classifier and improving accuracy. We take into account the nonlinear predictors and estimate the decision tree regressor, also compare it with linear regressor. By removing some of the sources of overfitting, the random forest accuracy is improved over the decision tree accuracy.
